## Nact is redux but for the server

Servers today are very different from those even 10 years ago. So why are we still programming like it's the 90s?

Inspired by the approaches taken by Akka and Erlang, Nact is an open source Node.js framework which enables you to take control of your state to:

- more effectively use memory
- improve application resiliance
- increase performance
- reduce coupling

With out of the box support for event sourcing, and a considered implementation of the actor model, Nact can work across a wide variety of domains.

Nact is no silver bullet, but it is evolving to tackle ever more demanding use cases. Perhaps one of them is yours?

## Getting started

Run `npm install --save reason-nact` and add `reason-nact` to the `bs-dependencies` in `bsconfig.json`.
